Microbial Simulation
======================
A fun and use friendly way to visualize how certain microorganisms grow in outer space environments. Future predictions can even show microbial behavior beyond the data collected.

:star: Leave a star if you like the project!

## Motivation
I am a pationate lover of outer space and the universe beyond our Earth. 
For my senior thesis in college, I'm writing about current planetary protections and discussing how recent and future space travel can contaminate our solar system with bacteria from Earth and vice versa.
After compiling data from various sources and combining my thesis with my passion for programming, this is a simulation of the data with extrapolations to determine which kinds of microorganisms could potentially survive in space and other planets.
